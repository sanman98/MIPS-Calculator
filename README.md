## Features

- Display welcome message and interactive menu  
- **Addition** → Reads two integers, adds them, and displays the result  
- **Subtraction** → Reads two integers, subtracts them, and displays the result  
- **Multiplication** → Reads two integers, multiplies them, and displays the result  
- **Division** → Reads two integers, divides them, and displays the result  
- **Exponentiation** → Raises one number to the power of the other and displays the result  
- **Mean** → Calculates and displays the arithmetic mean  
- **Remainder** → Computes the remainder of the division  

The program uses loops for user interaction, processes input, performs calculations, and displays results in a user-friendly console output.
